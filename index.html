				<p>Ticket machines are a ubiquitous feature in dense cities, but their difficult interface can result in fines, late arrivals, and towed cars for a variety of users. Both the information and physical machinery can often be overwhelming and overlook the needs of its users. We’re seeing a transition to mobile applications to resolve the issue, but this leaves out many populations who don’t have access to smartphones, or wifi/LTE.</p>  

				<p>Otter Parking is a quick, efficient, and accessible multimodal street parking experience that streamlines the parking process without dependency on a mobile phone. It was developed by Team UX Parking Authority in the Fall Quarter of 2020, for the Human Centered Design & Engineering 518 User Centered Design course at the University of Washington..</p>

			<h1>Project Goals</h1>
			<ul>
				<li>1. Create a clean, understandable interface</li>
				<li>2. Streamline the parking payment process</li>
				<li>3. Allow the user to only pay for the parking time used</li>
				<li>4. Avoid using smart phones as a solution, to make our solution equitable to all</li>
				<li>5. Correct the physical machine design to allow full access by all peoples</li>

			<h1>Ideation</h1>
			<p>To conduct our research, we used 3 methods that were complementary to each other and would also accommodate for the weaknesses of each other</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Surveys (built and deployed using Google forms – obtained 68 responses)</li>
				<li>Interviews (Scenario Testing research method – interviewed 6 people)</li>
				<li>Observations (Fly on the Wall research method – observed user interactions in 4 different parking machine contexts)</li>

					<h3>Ease of Use</h3>
					<h2>Tap In / Tap Out Process</h2>
					<ul>
						<li>Using an RFID-enabled Otter Card, a customer can tap in/tap out to pay for parking</li>
						<li>Customer can save their license plate for speedier service</li>
						<li>In the future, our goal is to combine with existing public transportation services to create an all-in-one card</li>

					<h2>Improved Visibility</h2>
					<ul>
						<li>Our goal was to increase the screen size from small black/white systems to full color 16x20" touch screens</li>
						<li>The jump in screen size provides a spacious keyboard, larger text and larger butttons</li>
						<li>Customers of all abilities felt more confident in their ability to select the right button without mistyping</li>

			<h1>Parking Meter Redesign</h1>
			<p>This machine type was chosen because it was familiar to our research participants. We wanted to focus on using a physical machine versus a phone application for two main reasons; so that users who do not have smartphones can still have an efficient parking system, and so users who are reliant on cell phones do not have to worry if their phone is charged and working to be able to pay for parking.</p>
		</div>

		<div class="section">
			<h1>RFID Card Concept</h1>
			<p>An RFID system was chosen because of its proven success in streamlining other modes of public transportation. The RFID system lends itself to a speedy interaction that is not dependent on WIFI or LTE. Additionally, with the “tap in”, “tap out” system the user can prevent overpaying for parking, because it eliminates the guesswork of how long they will need parking. The user only pays for the exact time they need, and not a minute longer.

		<div class="section">
			<h1>Map Receipt Concept</h1>
			<p>During our research we learned that there was room for improvement of the ticket artifact information and discovered that people sometimes forget where they park. We added a printable map in order to help orient users to their vehicle, so whether the user is from out of town or in a new neighborhood, they have a map that can help them find their way back to their car.</p>
